Mail from Arvid:
Hi,
I would like to have for each environment our testing scripts to be
executed as follows:
* from a central server
* every 10 minutes
* for 20 machines
* on every live environment: US, UK, Canada, ...
* with auto destroy
* sending a report to support@vscalers.com in case of a timeout or
failure
why? as we can have as many monitoring stuff activated, this test simply
tells us the core functionality is working and is effective. This will
helps us to detect problems before customers do!
I have discussed this with Jan today and he fully supports the idea
So as we have the scripts, we just need to find a place from where it
can run in a cron and add some logic for e-mail reporting ...
can you guys take this up? of course when/how, this is up to Jan who
will manage the OPS team planning.
thx!
Arvid
HOW:
- use already existing api test scripts to:
1) create and start 20 machines, with some delay in between them
2) drop them

Here is my findings:
1- The default profile was an empty profile called 'default-encryption'
2- After switching to the default profile I got 'LCP terminated by peer
(Encryption negotiation rejected)'
3- I've fixed that by changing the 'Use Encryption' setting to 'default'
instead of 'required', then I got 'CHAP authentication succeeded'
4- Then I got 'Could not determine local IP address', so I've changed
the IP pool from 'dhcpppp' to 'dhcp', then I've connected successfully.
All the mentioned changes has been rolled back to confirm with Jan
first.

Hi Matej,
Thank you for your feedback. You can go to the Port forwarding tap from
your home page, then you find the port forwarding table. Click on the
line which contains the rule you want to edit or delete. A pop window
will appear with a delete button down the window. You can delete your
rule from there. Try these steps and let me know if the issue still
remains I will be happy to assist you.

OK, this worked on my surface pro when I connected the mouse. It did NOT

More detail on the problem:

-          If I use surface as a tablet and tap on the rule, the pop up
that has the delete button, shows up, but it is not populated. The
delete button does nothing

-          If I use the mouse, the popup is populated with the port
forwarding rule and it can be deleted.

 

If you need, I can share the screen via join.me to demonstrate.

 

Matej

From the sentry data:

I believe this is an issue with the space between "yanic\'s" and
"snapshot" that has not been escaped. Bugfix?

I filtered out what are what are just the bugs, please look at it asap:
Machine used for testing: https://www.mothership1.com/wiki_gcb/MachineDeck#/edit/431[1]
In account: Operations

Once i was logged in using the console, i was not able to do anything.
Clicking on icons or other didn't had any effect (I'm using Google
Chrome)
After deleting, i tried to create a second snapshot and i got "An
unexpected error has occurred"
I've tried to create a few times a snapshot, when i look my change log,
i see that the snapshot is created but in reality it's failed
Not clear where i can see my error messages, the log also doesn't reveal
any details

Contact Wilbert for further questions: wilbert.ingels@cloudfounders.com[2]
Wilbert is a friendly user, sits here in the building on 2nd floor, so

Dear,
Sorry for the earlier e-mail, it was an internal note that was posted to
you by mistake.
We wanted to follow up on this ticket and wondered if you had received
an answer to your question.
We provide a documentation page on the S3 storage deck directly inside
the portal.
Please let us know if this is clear enough for you or if you need more
information.

To: support@centrilogic.com[2], support vscalers <support@vscalers.com[3]>
One of the SSD disks in CPU08.york1 (asset tag 13609) is B0rked.
Is there a replacement for it ? what would be the procedure to handle
that ?Only during Office hours?
Anyway, I think it just needs a wiggle, as it is suddenly non-existent
in the OS. Vibration maybe?I'd like to handle that with someone on the
phone/skype/chat.

Hi,
Due to hardware issues we needed to migrate your virtual machine to
another host. This should have been fully transparent and without
downtime but due to a manipulation error I have forcibly shutdown your
"ubuntu1404" virtual machine. Your machine is back up and running and
everything should be working again.
If you experience any issue with this machine, please to not hesitate to
contact us for support.
My sincerest apologies for any inconvenience caused.

The ssl proxy needs to be adjusted:

https://us1.mothership1.com/[1] uses a certificate for the correct
domain, this is ok
https://www.mothership1.com/[2] currently runs only on ca1, and is
signed as www.mothership1.com[3]. This is ok, but this key will need to
be shared with the us1 servers once they come online
https://ca1.mothership1.com/[4] is signed as www.mothership1.com[5],
which is incorrect.

so each domain needs it's own virtual host in nginx with it's own
certificates. We will need to get a new certificate for
ca1.mothership1.com[6].

Dear Team,
I highly recommend to use wildcard ssl certificate (little bit expensive
but very useful and cost-effective on high scale environments):
http://ssl.comodo.com/wildcard-ssl-certificates.ph...[1]
It'll be valid for www, us1, ca1, and *.mothership1.com,
I think we'll need another one for support.mothership1.com very soon,
and also to protect our internal systems/portals related to mothership1.

Right now all windows images are activated with a VLK key. This is a
security risk as users can simply read this key and use for any other
windows installation.
We need to set up a KMS server on each environment and activate the
images with our KMS key. That way they can only use the keys on our
network, and at the same time we get full license reporting.

I create the 2 VM in the opstools account & configure the ip proxy in
the routeros as follow:
1- routeros
enable proxy
/ip web-proxy set enabled=yes src-address=0.0.0.0 port=8080
/ip web-proxy add dst-port=23-25 action=deny comment="block telnet &
spam e-mail relaying" disabled=n
define the web servers
/ip dns static add name="exoplatform.incubaid.com
address=192.168.103.252
configure nat
/ip firewall nat add chain=dstnat in-interface=outside dst-address=<pub
ip> protocol=tcp dst-port=80 action=redirect to-ports=8080 comment=""
disabled=no
The web proxy will redirect traffic to exoplatform.incubaid.com the to
internal ip address which is 192.168.103.252
setup proxy
/ip proxy access add dst-port=80 dst-host="exoplatform.incubaid.com"
action=allow disabled=no
/ip proxy access add dst-port=80 dst-host="socialengine.incubaid.com"
action=allow disabled=no
2- exopaltform
- Prepare VM based on Ubuntu14.4
- Install exoplatform
- You can check it : http://exoplatform.incubaid.com [1] with
username:despiegk & password:R**
- Note "the dns name just for testing"
3-socialengine
- Prepare VM based on Ubuntu 14.4
- Because it is not free software during the setup the installation need
license key and i will try again
- If you prefer another free alternative software it will good if not i
will continue in its installation

Les,
Je vmmeke is +30G gegaan
inloggen:
[root@vm-1301 ~]# fdisk /dev/vda
Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.21.2).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.
Command (m for help): d
---> dit delete jouw partition, daarna:
Command (m for help): n
---> een paar keer enter ; tot je prompt terug krijgt
---> heeft dan een nieuwe (zelfde maar grotere) partitie teruggezet
Command (m for help): w
----> partitie weggeschreven
root@vm-1301 ~]# partprobe /dev/vda
---> lees partitie info terug in
ik vermoed dat je hier moet rebooten, maar je kan eens proberen zonder :
[root@vm-1301 ~]# resize2fs /dev/vda1
[root@vm-1301 ~]# df -h
---> is dit groot genoeg ?
(heb 10G meer gegeven, om eventueel een swapfile te creeren )
[root@vm-1301 ~]# fallocate -l 4096M /swapfile
[root@vm-1301 ~]# chmod 600 /swapfile
[root@vm-1301 ~]# mkswap /swapfile
[root@vm-1301 ~]# swapon /swapfile
[root@vm-1301 ~]# echo "/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

Lemme know if U have Probs

Thanks, but I created an account and played a bit as I am an analyst,
but do not have the time to continue to develop so it can be removed. If
I need to re-evaluate I will apply again.

Dear Roy ,
Thank you for analysing our technologie
Mothership1 stands for ;
KIS = Keep It Simple, basically what Apple did for desktops & phones we
are trying to do for cloud solutions
SECURITY = completely neglected in current cloud offerings, each machine
protected & VPN integrated
LOWEST TCO
EXTREMELY FAST = a new vmachine within 10 sec for linux, 20 sec for
windows (booted), all on SSD speeds
Hope to welcome you soon back on board for analysing more upcoming an
improved applications
best regards ,
frederic

Good morning,
I calculated the cost of hosting 1 months' backups and one server as a
DR environment, and the price is significantly more expensive than
expected:
1) Price per TB of S3 storage. ($0.03/GB * 1024 GB = $30.72/month/TB)
1a) Store 20TB of backups ($0.03/GB * 1024 * 20 = $614/month)
2) Price to initial load 4TB. ($0.12/GB * 1024 * 4 = $491.52 one time)
3) Price to transfer each month 20TB. ( ($0.12/GB * 1024 * 10) +
($0.09/GB * 1024 * 10 ) = $2150/Month)
4) Linux 4 $36/month
4a) 1024GB virtual HDD storage, $154.
$3477
Compared to AWS, that's significantly more expensive. We're transferring
quite a bit of data, and that seems to be a hot spot in this pricing. At
these prices, we couldn't afford to use Mothership1 even as a cold DR
site.

Kristof, can you check as well.
He has a point, as regards to storage:
1) same prices as Amazon.
2) we are indeed more expensive for initial load, so we can change that
3) is same price, data out at Amazon S3 is 0.12 as well
4) EBS is indeed a lot cheaper

Received From: arvid@mothership1.com Hi,
The prices are like the ones for Amazon S3, we see indeed that there is
a mistake in the Cloud Space bandwidth description and we will correct
it. We do not charge for the number of GET requests. Just like Amazon,
if it goes to the internet we charge. If it is from your server in the
Mothership1 datacenter, there is no charge.
Hope this clarifies the difference in costs.

HI Ken,
Did we answer you question and have you been able to verify that our
solution is substantially lower in price than Amazon?
We are working on a calculator to show the difference but it will prob
take till end next week before that will be done

There is one active machine:

u'referenceSizeId': u'8',
u'sizeId': 2,
u'stackId': 17,
u'status': u'RUNNING'},
I used console on the customers routeros:
[vscalers@298/012a] > ping 8.8.8.8
HOST SIZE TTL TIME STATUS
8.8.8.8 56 44 18ms
8.8.8.8 56 44 20ms

[vscalers@298/012a] > ping 192.168.103.252

192.168.103.252 timeout
192.168.103.252 56 128 551ms

sent=5 received=4 packet-loss=20% min-rtt=0ms avg-rtt=138ms
max-rtt=551ms
So both outside and inside networking is working.
Can you contact the customer again to verify if the issue is still
there.
Otherwise close the ticket.
I noticed also that there is in the beginnning some small delay when
pinging the internal network.
Can you create a internal ticket to investigate this behaviour.

Hello,
I was not sure about if Mothership is reliable product in long-term (I
feel
it as beta product). I afraid to facing situation like create -> use
instance for around year -> then Mothership decide to not continue
operation (So I need to migrate to other provider)
I can see Mothership backed by centrilogi/dacentec which very much
reliable
provider but a bit not sure about longterm plan for newly mothership
product yet.
By the way, is the vps created have public ip (When I create, I see only
private ip attach)

HI Zidit,
Why do you think this is a beta product? Interested to hear your
feedback.
The team behind this is very committed & experienced.
Look at www.incubaid.com[1]
we have done this before and very successfully.
About the private ip's that is by design, we don't want to allow
machines to directly go on the internet, its too dangerous.
Every machine is hosted in a private network and protected by an
enterprise capable private firewall.
You need to put a portforward rule to map between external IP & the
service you want to expose.
regards
Kristof
(CEO Mothership1)
